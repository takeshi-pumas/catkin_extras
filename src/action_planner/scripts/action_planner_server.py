def plan_command(command, model="koesn/mistral-7b-instruct", tools=tools, locations=locations_names):
    prompt = f"""
    You are a strict robot action planner. Only these actions exist exactly as defined:

    {tools}

    Known locations:
    {locations}

    Assumptions:
    - The robot always starts at "start_location" facing the user.
    - The user issuing the command is always at "start_location".
    - The word "me" in the command means the user at "start_location".
    - All required objects and people exist at expected locations.
    - Your output must always be a valid plan, no error handling needed.
    - Use exact Python syntax with double quotes for strings.
    - Output ONLY the plan variable in this exact format:

    plan = [
        # sequence of actions
    ]

    Important rules:
    - If the command includes "me" or implies the user, the robot must give the object to "user" at "start_location" using GiveObjectToPerson("user").
    - If the command names a different person or location as recipient, use GiveObjectToPerson(recipient) or GiveObject(location) accordingly.
    - Always navigate back to "start_location" after completing the main task unless the command explicitly states otherwise.
    - If the command involves reporting an attribute, usually a tell me action, answering a question, or stating a result (e.g., counting people), the robot must first gather the required information, then return to start_location to report it to the user.
    - The user is always at start_location, so there is no need to LocatePerson("user") or ask the user for help locating things.
    - Your plan must be a static sequence of actions, **no conditional statements, no if/else blocks, or branching logic inside the plan.**

    Examples:

    command = Get me a bowl from the kitchen
    plan = [
        Navigate("kitchen"),
        FindObject(object_name="bowl"),
        PickObject("bowl"),
        Navigate("start_location"),
        GiveObjectToPerson("user")
    ]

    command = Deliver the book on the table to Alex in the living_room
    plan = [
        Navigate("table"),
        FindObject(object_name="book"),
        PickObject("book"),
        Navigate("living_room"),
        GiveObjectToPerson("Alex"),
        Navigate("start_location")
    ]

    command = Tell me how many people in the bedroom are wearing orange sweaters
    plan = [
        Navigate("bedroom"),
        CountObjects(object_type="person wearing orange sweater"),
        Navigate("start_location"),
        ReportNumberOfPeopleWithAttribute("wearing orange sweaters")
    ]

    Now, provide ONLY the plan for this command:

    User command: {command}
